 Progrep reports the current status of MD or MC simulations, or,
 any long compute job performing a given number of iterations

 Usage: progrep [list | <PID> | mod | sample | api | help | license | uninstall]
 For job running on remote host: progrep [list | <PID>] [user@]hostname

 Options:
 
            --version and other info
            
 list       --list PID (process ID) of all active simulations 
              that have the progrep server installed. An empty 
              list means all such simulations/jobs are complete
              /terminated.    
 
 <pid>      --show progress report for simulation/job with 
              process ID = <PID> 
 
 mod        --create link for progrep.mod in current directory
           
 sample     --create link for sample code in current directory
           
 api        --create a sub-directory within your current directory
              containing the headers, library & modfile necessary
              for building/compiling code that uses the progrep API

 help       --show this help
              
 license    --show license for the installed distribution of progrep
 
 uninstall  --uninstall progrep if installed properly
 

 ##### For jobs running on Cluster / Remote node(s)
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Access the list of nodes your job is running on. Then:
 
 progrep [list | <PID>] [user@]nodename


 ##### API: How to Install progrep's Server in Your Code
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
 Look up sample code generated with command: progrep sample
 

 ##### (Optional) Interactive Mode for non-MPI jobs
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Run your simulation/job with command-line argument: progrep

 Example: ./simulation.bin progrep

 Note: If your program takes other arguments, the progrep 
 argument may be provided in any order with respect to those
